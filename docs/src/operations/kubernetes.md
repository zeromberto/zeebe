# Deploying to Kubernetes

We recommend that you use Kubernetes when deploying Zeebe to production.

Zeebe needs to be deployed as a [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/), in order to preserve the identity of cluster nodes. StatefulSets require persistent storage, which needs to be allocated in advance. Depending on your cloud provider, the persistent storage will differ, as it is provider-specific.

In the [zeebe-kubernetes](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-kubernetes) repository you will find example Kubernetes manifests to configure a three broker cluster with the Elastic Search exporter and the Operate preview. Examples are provided for provisioning storage on Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure.

There are many ways that you can provision and configure a Kubernetes cluster. And there are a number of architectural choices you need to make: will your workers run in the Kubernetes cluster or external to it?

You will need to configure your Kubernetes cluster and modify this to suit the architecture you are building.

## Gateway
Zeebe gateway is deployed as a stateless service.

We support [Kubernetes startup and liveness probes](./health.md#gateway) for Zeebe gateway.
